# Setup

## Make sure you have the following tools:
- A Linux computer (Mac and Windows welcome, but we'll be able to offer very limited support if any issues pop up, especially with Mac)
- An IDE (*Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Atom, VIM or something similar)
- Google Chrome or FireFox
- Node.js installed

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
